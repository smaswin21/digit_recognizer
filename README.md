# digit_recognizer
A simple custom digit recognizer implementation 


Tasks:
•Create 4 models for multi‐class classification of the input images
•A,B) Two Basic Machine Learning Models
•C) Multi‐layer Perceptron
•D) Simple Convolutional Network
•Development tools:
•Stand‐alone Jupyter Notebook
•Solutions Implemented with Sklearn, Tensorflow and/or Pytorch (free choice by each student 
or mini‐group)

Assignment Description – Overview  (2)

Tasks:
•Understanding and EDA of the dataset provided
•Build the Models
•Train the Models
•Cross‐Validation + Basic GridSearch hyper‐parameter tuning
•Performance report / Comparison of results
•Submit:
•Code (documented and executed)
•Models
•Selected model (ready to be scored independently with a “test” set)

Grading:

•As defined in the attached rubrics file, the grading will have 3 
components:
•35% CONCEPTUAL
•35% CODING
•30% BAKE‐OFF Ranking of results (performance)
•For the scoring and ranking of results an IID(*) “test” set will be used
•Note: the ranking grade is based on the “discrepancy” of performance with
respect to the average standard solution (only really under‐performing
models would have a significant penalty in this rubric)
